Changes in Manifest Version 3
=============================

Thunderbird 128 ESR is the first Thunderbird release to officially support Manifest Version 3.

A general introduction to Manifest V3 and the required changes is provided by `extensionworkshop.com <https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/manifest-v3-migration-guide/>`__. Thunderbird's add-on team made additional changes to its WebExtension APIs, to remove inconsistencies. This page
documents these backward incompatible changes from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3.

Additionally, the examples in our `sample repository <https://github.com/thunderbird/sample-extensions>`__ have been converted to Manifest V3, and might give helpful insights.
