Functions
=========

.. _cookies.get:

get(details)
------------

.. api-section-annotation-hack:: 

Retrieves information about a single cookie. If more than one cookie of the same name exists for the given URL, the one with the longest path will be returned. For cookies with the same path length, the cookie with the earliest creation time will be returned.

.. api-header::
   :label: Parameters

   
   .. api-member::
      :name: ``details``
      :type: (object)
      
      Details to identify the cookie being retrieved.
      
      .. api-member::
         :name: ``name``
         :type: (string)
         
         The name of the cookie to retrieve.
      
      
      .. api-member::
         :name: ``url``
         :type: (string)
         
         The URL with which the cookie to retrieve is associated. This argument may be a full URL, in which case any data following the URL path (e.g. the query string) is simply ignored. If host permissions for this URL are not specified in the manifest file, the API call will fail.
      
      
      .. api-member::
         :name: [``firstPartyDomain``]
         :type: (string, optional)
         
         The first-party domain which the cookie to retrieve is associated. This attribute is required if First-Party Isolation is enabled.
      
      
      .. api-member::
         :name: [``partitionKey``]
         :type: (:ref:`cookies.PartitionKey`, optional)
         
         The storage partition, if the cookie is part of partitioned storage. By default, only non-partitioned cookies are returned.
      
      
      .. api-member::
         :name: [``storeId``]
         :type: (string, optional)
         
         The ID of the cookie store in which to look for the cookie. By default, the current execution context's cookie store will be used.

   :label: Return type (`Promise`_)

   
   .. api-member::
      :type: :ref:`cookies.Cookie`

   :label: Required permissions

   - :permission:`cookies`

.. _cookies.getAll:

getAll(details)
---------------

.. api-section-annotation-hack:: 

Retrieves all cookies from a single cookie store that match the given information.  The cookies returned will be sorted, with those with the longest path first.  If multiple cookies have the same path length, those with the earliest creation time will be first.

.. api-header::
   :label: Parameters

   
   .. api-member::
      :name: ``details``
      :type: (object)

Events
======

.. _cookies.onChanged:

onChanged
---------

.. api-section-annotation-hack:: 

Fired when a cookie is set or removed. As a special case, note that updating a cookie's properties is implemented as a two step process: the cookie to be updated is first removed entirely, generating a notification with "cause" of "overwrite" .  Afterwards, a new cookie is written with the updated values, generating a second notification with "cause" "explicit".

OnChangedCause
--------------

.. api-section-annotation-hack::

If a cookie was automatically removed due to expiry, "cause" will be "expired". If a cookie was removed due to being overwritten with an already-expired expiration date, "cause" will be set to "expired_overwrite".  If a cookie was automatically removed due to garbage collection, "cause" will be "evicted".  If a cookie was automatically removed due to a "set" call that overwrote it, "cause" will be "overwrite". Plan your response accordingly.
