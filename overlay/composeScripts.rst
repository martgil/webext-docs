==================
composeScripts API
==================

This compose scripts API is the same as the
`content scripts`__ API except that it works on the document of email messages during composition.

See also :ref:`executeScript <tabs.executeScript>`, :ref:`insertCSS <tabs.insertCSS>`,
:ref:`removeCSS <tabs.removeCSS>`, and :doc:`messageDisplayScripts`.

.. note::

  Registering a compose script in the *manifest.json* file is not possible at this point.
