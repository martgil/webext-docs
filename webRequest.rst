Events
======

.. _webRequest.onAuthRequired:

onAuthRequired
--------------

.. api-section-annotation-hack:: 

Fired when an authentication failure is received. The listener has three options: it can provide authentication credentials, it can cancel the request and display the error page, or it can take no action on the challenge. If bad user credentials are provided, this may be called multiple times for the same request.

.. api-header::
   :label: Parameters for onAuthRequired.addListener(listener, filter, extraInfoSpec)

   
   .. api-member::
      :name: ``listener(details, asyncCallback)``
      
      A function that will be called when this event occurs.
   
   
   .. api-member::
      :name: ``filter``
      :type: (:ref:`webRequest.RequestFilter`)
      
      A set of filters that restricts the events that will be sent to this listener.
   
   
   .. api-member::
      :name: [``extraInfoSpec``]
      :type: (array of :ref:`webRequest.OnAuthRequiredOptions`, optional)
      
      Array of extra information that should be passed to the listener function.

Types
=====

.. _webRequest.BlockingResponse:

BlockingResponse
----------------

.. api-section-annotation-hack:: 

Returns value for event handlers that have the 'blocking' extraInfoSpec applied. Allows the event handler to modify network requests.

.. api-header::
   :label: object

   
   .. api-member::
      :name: [``authCredentials``]
      :type: (object, optional)
      
      Only used as a response to the onAuthRequired event. If set, the request is made using the supplied credentials.
      
      .. api-member::
         :name: ``password``
         :type: (string)
      
      
      .. api-member::
         :name: ``username``
         :type: (string)
      
   
   
   .. api-member::
      :name: [``cancel``]
      :type: (boolean, optional)
      
      If true, the request is cancelled. Used in onBeforeRequest, this prevents the request from being sent.
   
   
   .. api-member::
      :name: [``redirectUrl``]
      :type: (string, optional)
      
      Only used as a response to the onBeforeRequest and onHeadersReceived events. If set, the original request is prevented from being sent/completed and is instead redirected to the given URL. Redirections to non-HTTP schemes such as data: are allowed. Redirects initiated by a redirect action use the original request method for the redirect, with one exception: If the redirect is initiated at the onHeadersReceived stage, then the redirect will be issued using the GET method.
   
   
   .. api-member::
      :name: [``requestHeaders``]
      :type: (:ref:`webRequest.HttpHeaders`, optional)
      
      Only used as a response to the onBeforeSendHeaders event. If set, the request is made with these request headers instead.
   
   
   .. api-member::
      :name: [``responseHeaders``]
      :type: (:ref:`webRequest.HttpHeaders`, optional)
      
      Only used as a response to the onHeadersReceived event. If set, the server is assumed to have responded with these response headers instead. Only return :code:`responseHeaders` if you really want to modify the headers in order to limit the number of conflicts (only one extension may modify :code:`responseHeaders` for each request).
   
   
   .. api-member::
      :name: [``upgradeToSecure``]
      :type: (boolean, optional)
      
      Only used as a response to the onBeforeRequest event. If set, the original request is prevented from being sent/completed and is instead upgraded to a secure request.  If any extension returns :code:`redirectUrl` during onBeforeRequest, :code:`upgradeToSecure` will have no affect.
